### Phelma Digital Electronics Project: Harnessing ARM7 Architecture 

This project is a processor implementation based on the ARM7 instruction set architecture (ISA) for user mode. It is written in VHDL and has the following specifications:

* 32-bit architecture
* 16 general-purpose registers
* 3-stage pipeline
* Does not include any special registers specific to ARM7
* Basic custom memory interface

### Objective

The objective of this project is to fulfill the requirements of the "Digital Electronic Labwork" course at Grenoble-INP | SEI | PHELMA.

### Development Tools

The development of this project utilized the ModelSim Student Version software for simulation and verification purposes.
